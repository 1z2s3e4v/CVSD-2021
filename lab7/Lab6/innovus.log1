Clock Tree Violations Report
============================

The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.


Max Capacitance Violations
--------------------------

Did not meet the max_capacitance constraint of 0.000pF below the root driver for clock_tree CLK1 at (611.475,1058.370), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net CLK which has internal don't touch reasons: {is_pad_net}. Achieved capacitance of 3.752pF.

Max Slew Violations
-------------------

Found 1 slew violation below the root driver for clock_tree CLK1 at (611.475,1058.370), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net CLK which has internal don't touch reasons: {is_pad_net} with half corner Delay_Corner_max:setup.late. The worst violation was at the pin ipad_CLK/PAD with a slew time target of 0.234ns. Achieved a slew time of 0.375ns.

  Found a net with slew violations that have been marked as don't touch. 
  CCOpt will not be able to fix these violations directly.
  Consider removing the don't touch flag: {dbSet [dbGetNetByName net].isDontTouch 0}.

Clock Tree Violations Report
============================

The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.


Max Capacitance Violations
--------------------------

Did not meet the max_capacitance constraint of 0.000pF below the root driver for clock_tree CLK1 at (611.475,1058.370), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net CLK which has internal don't touch reasons: {is_pad_net}. Achieved capacitance of 3.752pF.

Max Slew Violations
-------------------

Found 1 slew violation below the root driver for clock_tree CLK1 at (611.475,1058.370), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net CLK which has internal don't touch reasons: {is_pad_net} with half corner Delay_Corner_max:setup.late. The worst violation was at the pin ipad_CLK/PAD with a slew time target of 0.234ns. Achieved a slew time of 0.375ns.



**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-1361):	Routing configuration for top nets in clock tree CLK1: preferred layers METAL3-METAL4 are outside NanoRoute configured layer range. This is likely to cause routing correlation issues.

    Clock Tree Violations Report
    ============================
    
    The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
    A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
    Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.
    
    
    Max Capacitance Violations
    --------------------------
    
    Did not meet the max_capacitance constraint of 0.000pF below the root driver for clock_tree CLK1 at (611.475,1058.370), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net CLK which has internal don't touch reasons: {is_pad_net}. Achieved capacitance of 3.752pF.
    
    Max Slew Violations
    -------------------
    
    Found 1 slew violation below the root driver for clock_tree CLK1 at (611.475,1058.370), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net CLK which has internal don't touch reasons: {is_pad_net} with half corner Delay_Corner_max:setup.late. The worst violation was at the pin ipad_CLK/PAD with a slew time target of 0.234ns. Achieved a slew time of 0.375ns.
